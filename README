AI-Robot
A reinforcement-learning-driven humanoid with Jetson Orin Nano and smart servos
🧠 Overview

AI-Robot is an ongoing humanoid robotics project focused on developing dynamic walking through reinforcement learning (RL).
The goal is to create a robot capable of adapting to changing environments, starting with stable locomotion on flat terrain and eventually integrating vision-based object detection and speech models for natural interaction.

This project represents an exploration into combining AI control systems with physical robotics, using RL to handle low-level motor control and a language model as the higher-level “brain” responsible for decision-making and communication.

⚙️ Features (Planned and In Progress)

Dynamic Walking with Reinforcement Learning

RL-based control for adaptive locomotion

Simulation-first training approach before deployment on hardware

Smart Serial Servo Control

Dual-servo setup using Feetech STS3235 and STS3250 actuators

Pulleys with 2:1 gear ratios at select joints for torque optimization

Custom Electronics

PCB with ESP32-S3 microcontroller for servo communication and power management

Jetson Orin Nano as the main compute module running the AI systems

Environmental Awareness (Future)

Integration of a vision system for obstacle perception and terrain recognition

Speech and Interaction (Future)

Onboard LLM to process voice commands and control robot behavior through natural language

🧩 System Architecture (In Development)
Component	Function
Jetson Orin Nano	Runs reinforcement learning models and manages high-level control
ESP32-S3 PCB	Interfaces with servos, manages serial bus communication and power
Smart Servos (Feetech STS3235 & STS3250)	Actuators for joints, supporting position feedback and serial daisy-chaining
Pulleys (2:1 ratio)	Increases effective torque at key leg joints
